      <p class="myquestion">
        Do you offer a maintenance plan?
      </p>
      <p class="myanswer">
        A credit card or debit card is required should you order online. The card you use for the initial payment will be
        automatically set up on our Easy Pay program for payment of the monthly re-rental of the instrument.
        Remember, you can return at any time after the initial rental period ends.

      <p class="myquestion">
        Is my rental instrument going to be new?
      </p>
      <p class="myanswer">
        Most of our rental instruments are like new. We strongly recommend renting a previously rented instrument,
        as they are fully shop adjusted to playing condition. This is also a great way for your
        child to get used to handling the instrument before they get a brand new one. Your rental payments do apply toward the purchase of a
        new instrument within the first year, and any instrument of equal or greater value thereafter.
